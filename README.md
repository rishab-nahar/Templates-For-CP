This Github repo consists of all significant DataStructure and Algorithms templates used by me in Competitive Programming Contests.
 I use both Python and C++ depending on the needs of the problem. There are two folders Python and C++, containing templates for that language. 
I wrote these codes over 1.5 years. The sources for these codes are various CodeForces Blogs, Codechef Blogs, Cp algorithms Blogs, Codes Submitted on CodeForces by Various Coders.

The codes written in C++ are also majorly focused so that typing codes become faster; therefore, there are uses of various Macros and functions that can speed up the process. Users are requested to use any of these codes along with templates. CPP.

Happy Coding :)
